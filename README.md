# Winterbitia's Kali Linux WSL Configuration

> Use `yadm` to easily use these configurations for yourself

These are the main configurations used for my **Kali Linux (WSL)** setup. Currently, this is my second ricing project which means I've learned to use a *dotfiles manager* (yadm) which will make this repository much easier to manage. Available configurations include:

* zshrc
* vimrc
* tmux
* oh-my-posh
* neowofetch

## Notable Dependencies

While these services don't neccessarily contain configuration files, they're very crucial in my setup to install on my WSL to have it running effectively.

* [libtmux](https://libtmux.git-pull.com/)

## Rose Pine Themes

**Rose Pine Moon** is one of the few color schemes I looked at for a short while and instantly fell in love with, to the point where I've used the scheme in many of my applications. You can find the themes listed in their [website](https://rosepinetheme.com/).
